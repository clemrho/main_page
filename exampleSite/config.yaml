        During my internship at Agora, I: 
      - Integrated the MongoDB database into video coding testing system and deployed the database on the remote server, made
      use of PyMongo to update data, avoided redundant execution of tests, accelerated the workflow of testing by 40% among
      20000+ test series.
      - Wrote python scripts to extract data from the database, using Pandas to load them into excel files and analyzed these data
      by numpy, calculated the variance of running cycles over 3000 performance series and controlled their fluctuations within
      0.05% variance of the mean cycle.
      - Restructured the sequences of the test system, first ran 15% of the series, then ran the rest according to the performance of
        the first part, effectively reducing 85% of the useless running cycle.
